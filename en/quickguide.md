## Lists in use
The lists you have chosen to use. They can be controlled seperately. eg. you can choose to see ads, which often gives you access to pass adblocking blockers -  we like ads, but we don't like tracking.

### Red light - controlling off

When a list is "red" the trackers in that list are not blocked.
#### Blocking a single tracker
If you have a list turned off, but want to block a single tracker from that list, you can control the trackers individually on specifically the site you visit. 

### Green light - controlling on
"Green" light means controlling is turned on.

#### Allowing a single tracker
If you have a list turned on, but want to allow a single tracker from that list, you can control the trackers individually on specifically the site you visit.

## Pause blocking

While you pause blocking, you can just avoid to visit other sites than the one you are using.
